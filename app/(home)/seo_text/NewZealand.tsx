                    <strong>Sheep Outnumber Humans:</strong>New Zealand is
                    famous for having more sheep than people! As of 2021, there
                    were about 29 million sheep in the country, compared to a
                    human population of around 5 million.

                    <strong>Kiwifruit Wasn't Originally Kiwi: </strong>Despite
                    being one of New Zealand's most iconic exports, the
                    kiwifruit is not native to the country. It originally came
                    from China and was known as the Chinese gooseberry before
                    New Zealanders renamed it.

                    region produces around 77% of the country's wine, and the
                    nation is particularly renowned for its world-class
                    Sauvignon Blanc.

                    in the world.

                    <strong>The Manuka Magic: </strong>New Zealand's Manuka
                    honey is highly sought after globally for its unique
                    medicinal properties, derived from the nectar of the native
                    Manuka bush.

                    its reputation as the "Carrot Capital" of New Zealand.
                    Similarly, in the Waikato town of Morrinsville, there's a

                    this meringue-based dessert, topped with fresh fruit,
                    remains an iconic dish in both nations, celebrating their

            <p>
                New Zealand, an island nation in the southwestern Pacific Ocean,
                is renowned for its breathtaking landscapes, diverse ecosystems,
                and a strong agricultural heritage. With fertile soils and a
                temperate maritime climate, the country provides ideal
                conditions for a variety of agricultural pursuits.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Its estimated that the agriculture sector, including fruits,
                    contributed to about 5% of New Zealand's GDP. However, exact
                    figures specifically for fruit production might vary and
                    should be checked with updated local statistics.

                <p>
                    New Zealand is home to a myriad of fruit crops. Some major
                    fruits include kiwifruit, apples, grapes, pears, cherries,
                    and berries. Kiwifruit and apples are dominant, with
                    kiwifruit accounting for about 30% and apples about 25% of
                    total fruit production. However, these percentages are rough
                    estimates and might require more recent data for accuracy.

                <p>
                    Approximately 50% of New Zealand's territory is used for
                    agriculture. Around 6% of the country's population is
                    employed in the agriculture sector.

                <p>
                    New Zealand's fruit production, especially kiwifruit and
                    apples, has generally been on the rise in recent years.
                    Kiwifruit exports have shown significant growth, often
                    seeing increases of 10% or more year on year.

                    Apples and kiwifruit are among the most exported fruits,
                    while fruits like berries are more commonly consumed
                    domestically.

                </p>
                <p>
                    New Zealand heavily relies on seasonal workers, especially
                    during peak harvest seasons. The Recognised Seasonal
                    Employer (RSE) scheme is an example of this reliance,
                    allowing overseas workers to assist in the agriculture
                    sector.

                <p>
                    New Zealand has over 50,000 farms, with a mix of both small
                    family-owned farms and larger corporate entities. However,
                    small farms still play a significant role in the industry.

                    New Zealand has several agricultural programs and

                    sustainability and environmental protection programs.

                    agriculture. The government actively supports the sector
                    through research, initiatives, and policy frameworks.

                    New Zealand's diverse landscape, from coastal areas to
                    fertile plains and alpine regions, allows for a broad range
                    of crops. The temperate climate, frequent rainfall, and rich
                    soils in certain regions make it particularly conducive for
                    fruit cultivation.

                    Earnings can vary widely based on the crop and region. As of

                    NZD 30 an hour, with kiwifruit often being among the highest
                    paying. However, wages might have changed, and up-to-date
                    local data is advisable.
