                    <strong>Midnight Sun Farming:</strong>Due to its location
                    above the Arctic Circle, parts of Norway experience the
                    phenomenon of the Midnight Sun, where the sun does not set
                    for several weeks during summer. This unique phenomenon
                    allows crops to grow faster due to the extended daylight
                    hours.

                    <strong>Tunnels for Strawberries: </strong>To protect
                    strawberries from the unpredictable Norwegian weather, many
                    farmers use tunnel greenhouses. This not only ensures a
                    longer growing season but also protects the berries from
                    heavy rains.

                    <strong>Cloudberries – The Gold of Arctic: </strong>Often
                    referred to as the "Gold of the Arctic," cloudberries are a
                    rare treat found in Norway's marshes and wetlands. They are
                    challenging to cultivate, making them a sought-after
                    delicacy.

                    <strong>Cheese Slicer Invention: </strong> While this is not
                    directly related to farming, it's an agricultural product
                    innovation. The cheese slicer, a now common kitchen tool,
                    was invented by a Norwegian named Thor Bjørklund in 1925,
                    revolutionizing the way cheese was consumed.

                    <strong>Old Norse Traditions: </strong>Some farmers still
                    adhere to old Norse traditions. For instance, there's a
                    belief that if you sprinkle your apple orchard with cider,
                    it will ensure a bountiful harvest.

                    <strong>World's Northernmost Vineyard: </strong>Believe it
                    or not, Norway boasts the world's northernmost vineyard,
                    situated in Tromsø. This vineyard challenges the norms of
                    where grapes can grow!

                    <strong>Vertical Farms in Cities: </strong>As part of its
                    push towards sustainability and technological adoption,
                    Norway has seen a rise in urban vertical farming. These
                    futuristic farms are designed to grow crops vertically in
                    layers, maximizing the use of space.

                    farmers are reviving ancient grains that have been
                    cultivated since the Viking Age. These grains are more
                    resilient and are believed to have health benefits.

                Info About Norway's Agriculture

            <p>
                Norway, located in Northern Europe, is known for its magnificent
                fjords, coastal beauty, and breathtaking mountainous terrains.
                While it's primarily recognized for its petroleum industry and
                fisheries, agriculture also has its place in the country's
                economy.

                    In recent years agriculture contributed 1.61% to the
                    national GDP.

                <p className="my-1">
                    While Norway's cold climate limits the variety of fruit that
                    can be grown, there are still some prominent fruits
                    cultivated: apples, berries (strawberries, raspberries,
                    blueberries, cloudberries), plums and pears most prominent.

                    Approximately 3% of Norway's territory is used for
                    agricultural production. Around 1.4% of the population is
                    engaged in the agriculture sector, either directly or

                </p>
                <p className="my-1">
                    The fruit production trend in Norway has generally seen
                    modest growth, especially in the berry sector due to
                    increased demand domestically and for exports. Due to recent
                    drastic changes in climate, Norwegian farmers have started
                    cultivating more exotic fruits like apricot, sea berry,
                    edamame beans, and sweet potato
                </p>
                <p>
                    The gross production value in the fruit market is projected
                    to amount to US$18.43 million in 2023, with an expected
                    annual growth rate of 2.13% from 2023 to 2028.

                    The fruits that generate most of the revenue in the
                    Norwegian market are largely imported tropical fruits,
                    including bananas, melons, kiwi fruit, pineapples, and
                    grapes. Bananas are particularly notable as a significant
                    import product when it comes to fresh fruits and vegetables.
                    Moreover, there's been growth in the imports of mandarins,
                    mangoes, avocados, lemons, and blueberries​

                    The revenue generated from the fruit and vegetable
                    processing industry in Norway for the year 2021 was
                    approximately six billion Norwegian kroner (540 million
                    USD). In 2022, the turnover of the processing and preserving
                    industry of fruit and vegetables in Norway remained nearly
                    unchanged at around 533 million euros.

                    <strong>Reliance on seasonal workers:</strong>
                </p>
                <p className="my-1">
                    The reliance on seasonal fruit pickers in Norway is notably
                    accentuated due to the country's relatively short growing
                    season, which typically spans from May to September, with
                    the intensive fruit picking period occurring from July to
                    October. This narrow window for fruit harvesting
                    necessitates a surge in labor, often filled by seasonal
                    workers to help with the harvest. Various farms start
                    looking for workers around this time and many vacancies are
                    advertised online on platforms like Picking Jobs, Workaway,
                    WWOOF Norway, One World 365, Indeed, EURES, and
                    Arbeidplassen.{" "}

                <p className="my-1">
                    Additionally, some farms in Norway offer fruit picking jobs
                    year-round, albeit not as intensely as during the summer
                    months. For instance, Auster Berget Gård in Bergmyran,
                    Rissa, Norway, has harvest times year-round for
                    strawberries, seasonal fruits, and seasonal vegetables,
                    indicating that while the need for fruit pickers surges in
                    the summer, some level of demand exists throughout the year.

                    size. While large farming corporations are present, small
                    farms still constitute a significant portion of the
