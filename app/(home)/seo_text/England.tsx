                    <strong>Old Agricultural Shows: </strong>England hosts some
                    of the world's oldest agricultural shows. The Great
                    Yorkshire Show, for instance, started in 1837 and continues

                    <strong>Bramley Apples: </strong>The original Bramley apple
                    tree, from which all Bramley apple trees are descended, is
                    over 200 years old and can still be found in Southwell,
                    Nottinghamshire.

                    <strong>Wool Production: </strong> In medieval times,
                    England was known for its wool. It was a huge export, and
                    the wool trade was so vital that there's even a saying
                    "England's wealth by wool", emphasizing its economic

                    Somerset, is famous for its apple orchards dedicated to
                    making cider. It's a tradition that dates back over a

                    the Cheese Rolling event at Cooper’s Hill in
                    Gloucestershire. Participants chase a round of Double
                    Gloucester cheese down a steep hill, and the first person to
                    cross the finish line at the bottom wins the cheese.

                    originating from Ireland but also found in England, is the
                    smallest native breed of cattle. They are often kept on
