                    <strong>Midnight Sun Farming:</strong>Due to its location
                    above the Arctic Circle, parts of Norway experience the
                    phenomenon of the Midnight Sun, where the sun does not set
                    for several weeks during summer. This unique phenomenon
                    allows crops to grow faster due to the extended daylight
                    hours.

                    <strong>Tunnels for Strawberries: </strong>To protect
                    strawberries from the unpredictable Norwegian weather, many
                    farmers use tunnel greenhouses. This not only ensures a
                    longer growing season but also protects the berries from
                    heavy rains.

                    <strong>Cloudberries – The Gold of Arctic: </strong>Often
                    referred to as the "Gold of the Arctic," cloudberries are a
                    rare treat found in Norway's marshes and wetlands. They are
                    challenging to cultivate, making them a sought-after
                    delicacy.

                    <strong>Cheese Slicer Invention: </strong> While this is not
                    directly related to farming, it's an agricultural product
                    innovation. The cheese slicer, a now common kitchen tool,
                    was invented by a Norwegian named Thor Bjørklund in 1925,
                    revolutionizing the way cheese was consumed.

                    <strong>Old Norse Traditions: </strong>Some farmers still
                    adhere to old Norse traditions. For instance, there's a
                    belief that if you sprinkle your apple orchard with cider,
                    it will ensure a bountiful harvest.

                    <strong>World's Northernmost Vineyard: </strong>Believe it
                    or not, Norway boasts the world's northernmost vineyard,
                    situated in Tromsø. This vineyard challenges the norms of
                    where grapes can grow!

                    <strong>Vertical Farms in Cities: </strong>As part of its
                    push towards sustainability and technological adoption,
                    Norway has seen a rise in urban vertical farming. These
                    futuristic farms are designed to grow crops vertically in
                    layers, maximizing the use of space.

                    <strong>Rare Ancient Grains: </strong> Some Norwegian
                    farmers are reviving ancient grains that have been
                    cultivated since the Viking Age. These grains are more
                    resilient and are believed to have health benefits.

            <p>
                Norway, located in Northern Europe, is known for its magnificent
                fjords, coastal beauty, and breathtaking mountainous terrains.
                While it's primarily recognized for its petroleum industry and
                fisheries, agriculture also has its place in the country's
                economy.

                    While Norway's cold climate limits the variety of fruit that
                    can be grown, there are still some prominent fruits
                    cultivated: apples, berries (strawberries, raspberries,
                    blueberries, cloudberries), plums and pears most prominent.

                <p>
                    Approximately 3% of Norway's territory is used for
                    agricultural production. Around 1.4% of the population is
                    engaged in the agriculture sector, either directly or
                    indirectly.

                    The fruit production trend in Norway has generally seen
                    modest growth, especially in the berry sector due to
                    increased demand domestically and for exports. Exact numbers

                    Apples and berries, particularly strawberries, are primarily

                    raspberries also have a good export market.

                <p>
                    Norway does rely on seasonal agricultural workers,
                    especially during the berry picking season. The exact

                <p>
                    Norway has several thousand farms, but there has been a
                    trend of a declining number of farms with increased farm
                    size. While large farming corporations are present, small
                    farms still constitute a significant portion of the
                    agricultural landscape.

                    Norway has various programs aimed at supporting farmers and

                    subsidies, training, and technical support.
