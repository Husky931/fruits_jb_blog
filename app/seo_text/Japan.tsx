                    <strong>Shiitake Mushrooms: </strong>While not a fruit,
                    shiitake mushrooms are a significant agricultural product in
                    Japan. They are grown mainly on Shikoku Island and are
                    integral to Japanese cuisine.

                <li>
                    <strong>Square Watermelons: </strong>In Japan, farmers grow
                    square-shaped watermelons, mainly for aesthetic reasons and
                    easier storage. These cubic watermelons are produced by
                    placing them in square tempered glass cases while they're
                    growing.

                <li>
                    <strong>Wasabi Farms: </strong>Real wasabi (as opposed to
                    the horseradish-mustard mix often served abroad) is
                    cultivated in flowing freshwater streams, primarily in the
                    Shizuoka prefecture. It requires precise conditions, making
                    it one of the most challenging plants to grow.

                <li>
                    <strong>Aomori Garlic: </strong> Aomori, while famous for
                    its apples, also produces black garlic known as "black
                    ninniku" in Japan. This unique product is fermented and has
                    a sweet, jelly-like texture.

                <li>
                    <strong>Nebuta Festival: </strong>Aomori prefecture
                    celebrates its apple industry and other aspects of regional
                    culture with the Nebuta Festival, where massive lantern
                    floats are paraded through the city.

                <li>
                    <strong>Rice Terraces: </strong>Japan is home to beautiful
                    rice terraces, like the ones in Shiroyone Senmaida. These
                    terraces showcase the meticulous care taken by Japanese
                    farmers to make the most of hilly and mountainous terrains.

                    <strong>Tokyo's Urban Farms: </strong>Believe it or not,
                    Tokyo, one of the world's most bustling metropolises, has
                    urban farms. These rooftop and pocket gardens provide fresh
                    produce to local communities, showcasing the blend of
                    tradition and modernity.

                <li>
                    <strong>Edible Chrysanthemums: </strong>Japan cultivates a
                    type of chrysanthemum, known as "Shungiku," which is edible
                    and often used in salads and hot pots.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Sake Production: </strong>Sake, Japan's iconic rice
                    wine, relies on high-quality rice. There are specific
                    varieties cultivated exclusively for sake production, with
                    Niigata and Fushimi being renowned regions for their premium
                    sake rice and breweries.

                <li>
                    <strong>Satoyama: </strong>This is a Japanese term referring
                    to the border zone between mountain foothills and arable
                    flat land. These areas, with their blend of forests, rice
                    paddies, and human dwellings, represent a harmonious
                    interaction between nature and man, fostering biodiversity
                    and sustainable agriculture.

                Japan, an archipelago in East Asia, is renowned for its unique
                blend of ancient traditions and cutting-edge modernity. Its
                diverse climatic zones allow for a variety of fruit crops to be
                cultivated across different regions.

                <p>
                    About 12% of Japan’s territory is used for agriculture, and
                    roughly 3-4% of its population is involved in this sector.

                <p>
                    On a general scale, Japan's self-sufficiency in fruits has
                    been on a decline due to various factors like aging farmers
                    and extreme weather events.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Most fruits in Japan are consumed domestically, particularly
                    citrus fruits, apples, and strawberries. Apples and
                    strawberries also make up a significant portion of fruit
                    exports.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Japan relies moderately on seasonal agricultural workers,
                    especially during peak harvest seasons. This demand is
                    particularly strong for fruits that require manual
                    harvesting.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Japan has over 1.2 million farms. The country mostly relies
                    on small-scale farming; however, there's a slight trend
                    towards consolidation and larger farming entities.

                    The Japanese government has various subsidy programs and
                    initiatives to support farmers, especially those involved in
                    sustainable and organic farming.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Japan is keen on adopting technology in farming, such as
                    drones for crop monitoring and robots for harvesting. The
                    government plays an active role in research, subsidies, and
                    promoting innovation in the agricultural sector.

                    Agriculture provides jobs for around 1.9 million people,
                    both constant and seasonal. These jobs range from farm
                    management, fruit picking, to processing and distribution.

                    Japan's mountainous terrain with various microclimates
                    allows for different fruits to be cultivated in different
                    regions. For example, colder regions like Aomori are
                    suitable for apple cultivation, while warmer coastal areas
                    are apt for citrus fruits.

                    Earnings vary based on the fruit and region. On average,
                    workers can expect JPY 800 to JPY 1,500 per hour. Strawberry
                    picking often pays well due to its popularity and the
                    delicacy required.
