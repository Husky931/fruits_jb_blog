                    <strong>Size Matters: </strong>One U.S. farm feeds 166
                    people annually in the U.S. and abroad. The global number

                The United States of America, the melting pot of nations all
                over the world, spans across 50 states and showcases a vast
                variety of landscapes ranging from vast plains, mountains,
                forests, and coastal regions. This geographical diversity
                contributes to its agricultural prowess.

                    About 44% of the USA's land area is used for agricultural
                    purposes. Roughly 1.3% of the American population is
                    employed in the agricultural sector.

                    The fruit production trend in the USA has seen fluctuations,
                    but there's a general increase in organic and sustainable
                    farming methods. The precise numbers can vary based on
                    annual reports.

                    The agriculture sector generates hundreds of billions of
                    dollars annually. Breaking down the revenue for each crop
                    would require more specific data.

                </p>
                <p>
                    The USA heavily relies on seasonal agricultural workers,
                    especially during harvest seasons. Many of these workers are
                    migrants.

                    There are approximately 2 million farms in the USA. While
                    there's a presence of massive agricultural corporations,
                    many farms are family-owned and medium-sized.

                    The USA has multiple farming and agricultural programs,
                    including those run by the USDA (United States Department of
                    Agriculture) that support farmers and promote sustainable
                    practices.

                    The USA's agricultural sector is technologically advanced,
                    with a growing trend towards automation and precision
                    agriculture. The government plays a pivotal role, offering
                    subsidies, grants, and support programs.

                    The agriculture sector, including seasonal work, provides

                    Natural Landscape's Relation:The USA's diverse landscape,
                    with its varied climates, allows for the growth of a wide
                    variety of fruits. For instance, the humid conditions in
                    Florida favor citrus, while the cooler climates of
                    Washington state are ideal for apple orchards.

                    Earnings for seasonal picker workers can range from the
                    federal minimum wage to slightly higher rates, often
                    depending on the state and the specific fruit. For instance,
                    apple picking in Washington might yield higher earnings than
                    berry picking in the South. Precise minimum and maximum
                    possible earnings would require up-to-date wage data for the
