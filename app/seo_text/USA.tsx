                forests, and coastal regions. This geographical diversity
                contributes to its agricultural prowess.

                    The fruit production trends in the USA for the 2023/24
                    season exhibit a mixed outlook. The US Department of
                    Agriculture's National Agricultural Statistics Service
                    (NASS) has forecasted increases in the production of certain
                    fruits and tree nuts, while others are expected to see a
                    decline. Here are some key points regarding the fruit

                    The production of almonds, apples, apricots, grapes, pears,
                    sweet cherries, and walnuts is expected to increase. This
                    positive trend is attributed to favorable spring weather in
                    the Pacific Northwest, which significantly benefited apple
                    and sweet cherry productions.

                    On the contrary, the production of peaches, tart cherries,
                    and cranberries is expected to decrease. This decline is
                    linked to various factors, including a cool spring which
                    lowered yields for some earlier blooming crops, inadequate
                    chill hours, and spring freeze events, especially in the
                    mid-Atlantic and Southeast regions, causing declines in the

                    decline compared to the previous years, as it was $7.1
                    billion in 2019 and $6.9 billion in 2020, with Canada

                    Launched by the USDA in September 2023, this program
                    addresses labor shortages in agriculture by utilizing up to

                    migration through legal pathways, and enhancing labor
