                agricultural industry. With its Mediterranean climate, Spain
                offers optimal conditions for a wide range of crops, including
                an array of fruit crops.

                    The fruit-producing trend in Spain has been on the rise,

                    While many fruits like olives and citrus fruits are consumed
                    domestically, Spain is also one of the largest exporters of
                    these. Berries and stone fruits have seen a surge in export
                    in recent years.

                <p>
                    Spain heavily relies on seasonal agricultural workers,
                    especially during the harvest season of various fruits. Many
                    come from other European and African countries.
